## 📜 About this app

Students often face barriers and a lack of opportunity when trying to find hands-on experience in their field of choice. The Source Catalyst application offers a simple and cost-effective solution: **student internships**.

With this platform, students can:
- Gain the skills they need to succeed in the workplace.
- Make connections for future careers.
- Build their resumes.

The traditional internship model often lacks structure, support, and guidance. Recognizing this, we've created an application that enables students to:

- Learn and grow through their internships.
- Keep track of their projects and internships.
- Freely access all the study material required to complete their internship.
- Contact their mentors for special guidance whenever needed.

Our user-friendly approach ensures that the internship experience is smooth and hassle-free. Moreover, upon the completion of the internship, students are rewarded with a certificate and a letter of recommendation, bolstering their professional profile.
